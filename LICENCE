This software is based on Adobe’s PDF Reference, Third Edition, version 1.6. There may be limitations on the use of this library based on patent restrictions from Adobe. See below for more information.
UNISYS LZW PATENT

This software does not fully conform to the Adobe PDF specification because no support for LZW is included in this software.

Adobe desires to promote the use of PDF for information interchange among diverse products and applications.
